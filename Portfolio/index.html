        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Pugazhenthi – a passionate learner, coder, and aspiring innovator. Currently diving deep into the realms of technology, finance, and philosophy, I aim to make sense of the world through the lens of curiosity and problem-solving.

            As a student selected at Zoho Schools of Technology, I’m focused on honing my skills in Python, database management (MySQL, SQLite3), and software development, while exploring object-oriented programming (OOP) and AI-based solutions. Whether it's building a personal CLI-based expense tracker or conceptualizing Dimensional Syncretism, I love connecting the dots between the abstract and the practical.
            
            With a deep interest in tech, science, and philosophical concepts, I aspire to apply my knowledge to real-world projects, turning ideas into functional code that pushes boundaries. I'm actively learning to broaden my toolset and improve my ability to create versatile, user-friendly apps.
            
            I believe in the power of hands-on learning and tackling challenges head-on, often preferring to build and fix things myself to truly understand the process. Whether it's through complex coding projects, expanding my financial literacy, or diving into deep scientific theories, I’m always looking for ways to grow, innovate, and contribute to meaningful work.
            
            Feel free to explore my projects and ideas below – I’m excited to share my journey with you!</p>
